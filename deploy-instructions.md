# How to Deploy to Your Netlify Account

Since the site was deployed from this development environment, you'll need to deploy it to your own Netlify account. Here are three ways to do it:

## Method 1: Quick Deploy (Drag & Drop)

This is the fastest way:

1. **Build the project** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Find the `out` folder** that was created in your project directory

3. **Go to Netlify**:
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Log into your account

4. **Deploy**:
   - Simply drag and drop the entire `out` folder onto your Netlify dashboard
   - Netlify will automatically deploy your site
   - You'll get a new URL like `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`

## Method 2: Connect to Git Repository

For ongoing updates:

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Push this code to that repository

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - In Netlify, click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub and select your repository
   - Set these build settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `out`
   - Click "Deploy site"

## Method 3: Netlify CLI

If you prefer command line:

1. **Install Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts** to connect to your Netlify account

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Once deployed, you can:
1. Go to your site settings in Netlify
2. Click "Domain management"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow the DNS setup instructions

## The Current Deployment

The site at `https://chipper-biscuit-4cfd01.netlify.app/` was deployed from this development environment, which is why you can't see it in your personal Netlify account. Use one of the methods above to get it into your own account where you can manage it properly.
